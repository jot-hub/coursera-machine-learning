# Machine learning Specialization
Contains code with solutions for all practice labs and optional labs in [Coursera's](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) machine learning specialization

I originally wanted to do the solutions in my local IDE (VSCode) but after finishing the course, I realized I might as well push it to Github, maybe it helps someone.

I setup venv locally and I suggest that you do as well.
